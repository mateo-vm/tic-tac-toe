# Tic Tac Toe

This is a basic Tic Tac Toe game developed on Python. It is possible to play against an IA or against a second player.

Instructions:

  - The board is divided in a matrix as follows:
  
    7 | 8 | 9
    - + - + -
    4 | 5 | 6
    - + - + -
    1 | 2 | 3
    
  - In first place, Player 1 must state which charaters wants to use.
  
  - Then, the game will ask if there is a second player or if it is going to be the IA.
  
  - Finally, the game starts!
